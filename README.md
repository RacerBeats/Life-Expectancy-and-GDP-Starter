Codecademy Portfolio Project, GDP & Life Expectancy.

# GOALS:
    - Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations
    - get familiar with the process of presenting and sharing data visualizations
    - Apply Univariate and Bivariate analysis into my findings
    - Explore relationship b/w  nation’s GDP & avg life expectancy over time.

# Data:
    - A CSV list of 6 countries with year, GDP, and Life Expectancy, 15 years apiece

    ## Variables:
        - Country
        - year
        - Life Expectancy at Birth (years)
        - GDP
        Limitations:
        data set is pretty small. only 6 countries to compare from.

# Analysis
    - exploratory data analysis, using descriptive stats for each metric
    - Bivariate analysis of each country, comparing GDP and Life expectancy over time, or GDP and Life Expectancy together to find any correlation
